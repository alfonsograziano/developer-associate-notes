Hi, just a couple of clarifications: 
1) I'm sorry if this document is not well formatted but it is just the study material I have generated during my AWS CDA exam.
2) As you can see, there are some pasted image references. I will not add those images because are just screenshots of the great Stephane Maarek course
3) If you find strange markdown syntax is just because I've used Obsidian to build notes so, for example [[Sviluppo]] is the reference to another document :) 

If you enjoy my notes please hire me! (just kidding... or maybe not?)
